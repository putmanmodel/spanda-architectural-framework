# Spanda Architectural Framework – Papers Trilogy

This repository contains the three foundational architectural papers underlying the **Spanda Engine** simulation framework.

These documents define a constraint-grounded approach to artificial agents that are:

- **Non-omniscient**
- **Structurally bounded**
- **Temporally persistent**
- **Field-coupled but stability-aware**

The trilogy formalizes dimensional inference, stratified memory persistence, and multi-agent reference dynamics as **architectural principles**, not philosophical claims.



## Overview

Spanda is built around a single design commitment:

**Artificial agents must infer only what their constraint surfaces justify.**

From this foundation, the trilogy develops:

1. Constraint-grounded dimensional inference  
2. Stratified time-scaled memory architecture  
3. Reference-shift field dynamics in multi-agent systems  

Each paper stands independently, but together they define the structural logic of the Spanda Engine.



## Papers

### Paper 1  
**Constraint-Grounded Dimensional Inference in Artificial Agents**  
Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/records/18700957  

Establishes the epistemic boundary condition for non-omniscient agents.

Key contributions:
- Representation as a structural requirement for agency  
- Constraint surfaces as epistemic limits  
- Higher-dimensional inference only via invariant boundary effects  
- Explicit rejection of architectural omniscience  



### Paper 2  
**Stratified Memory and Time-Scaled Persistence in Artificial Agents**  
Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/records/18701137  

Introduces a three-tier memory architecture:

- Short-term volatile state  
- Intermediate compressed regularity  
- Structural priors  

Key contributions:
- Hybrid continuous/discrete memory semantics  
- Pressure- and viscosity-gated assimilation  
- Residual activation as regulated imbalance  
- Identity-binding as weighted persistence  



### Paper 3  
**Reference Shift and Constraint-Field Dynamics in Multi-Agent Systems**  
Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/records/18701215  

Extends the framework to distributed systems.

Key contributions:
- Reference alignment as the primary instability predictor  
- Concentration density over mean activation  
- Asymmetric amplification modeling  
- Dissipation capacity and stability boundaries  
- Two cascade regimes (amplification-dominant vs inhibition-dominant)

Collective instability is framed as a structural phase transition within shared constraint fields.



## Design Philosophy

This trilogy is **not**:

- A psychological theory  
- A sociological theory  
- A metaphysical claim  

It is **technical documentation** describing how the Spanda Engine is architected.

The framework prioritizes:

- Bounded inference  
- Explicit structural limits  
- Measurable instability criteria  
- Simulation-ready formalism  
- Non-omniscient design discipline  

All claims are architectural and falsifiable within simulation contexts.
